## Project Overview

 [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/QVRRlVbs/causing-the-lost-website)

A single page application built for a stakeholder. It includes a landing page with info about the brand, a gallery, and a contact section. It also has a storefront that allows the user to buy items and an admin tools page that allows a verified user to add, edit, and remove items, and fulfill orders. 

###  Key Features

- Landing page
- Storefront
- Admin Tools

##  Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### React
![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-v16.13.1-blue.svg)

- React is highly customizable with 3rd party wrappers and libraries
- React handles single page applications extremely well and can be expanded to multipage applications easily
- React puts most of the rendering on the client, thus reducing the amount of server power required

#### Redux
![Redux](https://img.shields.io/badge/react-redux-v7.2.0-blue.svg)

- Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps
- Redux provides a solution for "prop drilling", where state gets passed as props from a top level component into a deeply nested component
- Redux is an elegant solution for a messy problem, it can also be scaled up

#### Front-end deployed to Vercel
- Front-end is deployed to Vercel using continous integreation in combination with GitHub

##APIs
